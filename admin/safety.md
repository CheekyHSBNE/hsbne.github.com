### WHS Legislation Note 
As HSBNE does not employ anyone, it is not specifically required to adhere to WHS legislation [as advised by Worksafe QLD](https://www.worksafe.qld.gov.au/laws-and-compliance/workplace-health-and-safety-laws/specific-obligations/non-profit-organisations-and-volunteers ) That being said, we have some basic principals of safety and provide and encourage use of PPE as best effort.

### Rules
Hard and fast, these are the ones with consequences. Please abide by them.

1. If safety concerns are raised by another person, you must stop what you are doing, and agree upon reasonable safety measures before continuing.
1. You may never utilise a tool marked for inductions without having attended and passed said induction.
1. No person at HSBNE shall work on any electrical project or installation with a voltage greater than ELV. (as defined by AS/NZS 60950.1:2003 as "a voltage not exceeding 42.4 V peak or 60 V d.c.") unless they are appropriately trained and licensed.
1. No person may leave any hazardous items unattended in the space, such as but not limited to:
	- Exposed wiring above ELV. (suicide cords, damaged tool cables etc)
	- Unlabelled chemicals or chemicals in a container that would otherwise contain food. (no acetone in water bottles etc)
	- Unsecured flammables. (Don't leave paint thinner in the welding area)

## Basic Principles
We consider these principles to be self evident and 'common sense', in order for everyones experience at HSBNE to run smoothly. Not acting in line with these is considered a 'dick move' in bird culture.

### General Concepts

- Always consider the safety of yourself and others.
- Consider your apparel for safety. Tie back long hair, remove wedding rings, wear closed shoes.
- Consider your surroundings. IE, notify others in the room if you are about to start making loud noise.
- Everyone is encouraged to question safety openly, without animosity or fear of reprisal.
- All hazards must be reported immediately by tagging with a 'Borked or Broken' ticket and emailing issues@hsbne.org (The sign-up kiosk also has a report issues form.)
- Always use suitable personal protective gear, this means at a minimum goggles in the workshops.
- Ensure tools and areas are left in a clean and serviceable condition upon your departure.

### PPE (Personal Protective Equipment)
- You are strongly advised by HSBNE to wear appropriate PPE.
	- Rooms are designated with PPE recommendations
	- Tools are designated with specific PPE recommendations
		- Note that some tools specifically prohibit certain PPE, for example no gloves at the lathe.
- While HSBNE tries to provide basic PPE, you are encouraged to purchase and provide your own, as it will most certainly be of a higher quality and comfort.
- If PPE is missing, report it immediately by emailing issues@hsbne.org.

Register of Injuries
If you come into injury at the space in any way, minor or major, please report it to executive@hsbne.org. This is so that they may maintain a register of injuries, which can be used to assess the space for environmental or policy changes.
