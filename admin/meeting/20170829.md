## Agenda
- Brisbane Festival
- Interlock hardware core parts ($1200)
- Two induction soldering irons and parts ($750)
- Creality CR-10 3D Printer ($700)

## Meeting Notes
- Brisbane Festival - we will be holding 4x 1 hour sessions on scribble bots, and are currently looking for volunteers to run these sessions; please indicate your your interest on the Google sheet in the applicable forum post.
- A working bee was held to clear the area behind the work sheds for the new woodshop container; the area has nearly been cleared for the new container, but some work still remains - this will be carried out on Saturday 2nd September.
- A working bee to construct the new interlocks has been raised, this will be held in the upcoming month for a couple of hours.
- A working bee will be held at the end of September to remove the annex in the woodshop

## Treasury Report
- $3441 for causes to spend

## Votes
- Interlock parts - this is for the second version of the interlock (compared to the one on the table saw); it is smaller and more modular, using a smaller contactor and a different Sonoff board; a working prototype exists, costing approximately $60 per interlock; 0 opposed, 2 abstained, ****motion passed****.
- Induction soldering irons - these are of a similar type to the Metcal unit we have, however these new irons have an auto-off function to prevent tip oxidation, as well as temperature-controlled tips; the proposed budget is for two units and a number of spare tips; 0 opposed, 2 abstained, ****motion passed****.
- CR-10 3D Printer - DigiFab have already purchased one unit, the second unit will allow us to retire both of the older units - these are less hobby-grade, but they can be repaired with parts on-site, a deal has been made with Creality for "Buy 3 for the price of 2"; 0 opposed, 0 abstained, ****motion passed****.

## Thanks
- Craig for organising woodshop working bee
- Craig, Stuart, Beau, Eris and Josh (among others) for their works to remove the concrete structure behind the woodshop
