## Agenda
- Container Shelter and End Wall ($1650)
- Supanova Parts and Kits budget ($800)
- Woodshop Working Bee (26-27 August)
- Induction/Orientation Day discussion

## Meeting Notes
- Woodshop working bee will be carried out on the 26th and 27th of August to clear the concrete from behind the woodshop and metal shop to allow for the ingress of a container, all help given is appreciated and will be fed
- Induction/Orientation day discussion - there have been a number of members wanting to help out at the 'Space, but are unsure on how to do so; a suggestion is to have the cause leaders run section inductions and a how-to for some of the larger items once a month; there could also be a "How To HSBNE" guide made detailing how to open/close the site as well as general maintenance - this would help to lighten the load of the executive and cause leaders
- As we are approaching Supanova we need to organise panels and workshops to advertise and hold both at the 'Space and at Supanova, the panel submissions for Supanova shall be made as soon as possible
- Brisbane Area WiCEN (Wireless Institute Civil Emergency Network) are looking to hold their meetings at HSBNE, we are looking forward to working with the group

## Treasury Report
- $2342 for causes to spend

## Votes
- Container Shelter and End Wall - this is to allocate a budget for the items, once approval is gained from the landlord it shall be acquired, the items shall be deemed structural; 0 opposed, 0 abstained, ****motion passed****.
- Supanova Parts and Kits budget - it has been found that it will be easier to purchase the kits and parts from the members for sale at Supanova than it will be to reimburse them post-show; 0 opposed, 0 abstained, ****motion passed****.
