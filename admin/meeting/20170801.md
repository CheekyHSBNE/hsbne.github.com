## Agenda
- Angle Grinders and Cutting Discs ($357)
- Lathe DRO ($350)
- Metal Shop Working Bee report

## Meeting Notes
- Change Exchange appears to be lacking of the appropriate amount of funds, if it is not reimbursed appropriately it will be removed
- SpaceBucks system is fully functional
- There is a new grant that we are applying for; the Stronger Communities grant provides a matched funding grant for approved applicants to subsidise the purchase of equipment
- In regards to the proposed roof over the blacksmithing area, commercial-grade units can be sourced for $3500, Lloyds Auctions have units for cheaper; Buzz has sourced a unit for $1650, and we will be checking with the landlord in regards to height approvals
- There is an open day, as well as a working bee to clear the hardstand this Saturday (5/8)
- Woodshop has gained approval for the container and to remove the annex room, a working bee for this will be forthcoming
- Dave Seff has stepped down from the position of cause leader for the Metal Shop; Drew Spriggs has taken up this role.
- More classes for the final half of the year need to be scheduled, 10% of proceeds from these shall be paid to the Space.
- Metal Shop Working Bee report - we have thrown out a lot of garbage in the metal shop, as well as chasing people in regards to outstanding projects; the plans are to move the hot work to the far end of the shop and the cold work to the end closer to the Wood Shop; once we have toom we will be looking at new tooling

## Treasury Report
- $3541 for causes to spend

## Votes
- Angle Grinders and Cutting Discs ($357) - these are required to replace the broken items that we already have, they will use 125mm cutting discs; ideally this would come out of the Metal Shop budget; 0 opposed, 4 abstained, ****motion passed****.
- Lathe DRO (Digital Readout) ($350) - this allows for more precise works to be created, this will be going onto Ollie's old lathe and is a reimbursement for items already purchased; 0 opposed, 1 abstained, ****motion passed****.

## Thanks
- Drew for stepping up for the metal shop cause
- Dave for acting as the metal shop cause leader
- James for works on the "stabbing machine"
- Drew for running the working bee, as well as Steph, Doc, Don Short, Sven, James and Phil for assistance
