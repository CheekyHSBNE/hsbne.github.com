## Meeting Notes
- We had visitors from Griffith University talking about the upcoming Science Hack Day that will be held at our premises on the weekend of the 17-18th of March; this will display scientific works from low- to high-tech in a broad range of operations; they are seeking volunteers for assistance in set-up and operation of the event, as well as science-related projects; for further information brisbane.sciencehackday.org
- We had a visit from Konrad from The Robotics Club, talking about the upcoming Self-Driving Car Hackathon that they will be conducting between the 16th and the 18th of February; they will be purchasing a $2,500 car to retro-fit to operate remotely; for further information www.theroboticsclub.org
- There will be a Craft Punk meeting after the general meeting
- Due to limitations with Slack, we are moving our instant messaging to Discord; please use this as we will be discontinuing the Slack page.
- There have been cans removed from the store room, this is entirely unacceptable behaviour as it impacts directly on the members.
- There will be a Cosplay and Craft meet on the 27th of January.

## Treasury Report
- $49,000 in the account, of which we can spend $5000

## Votes
- Plywood sheets for Speakers ($260) - we are seeking to construct boxes for the speakers that are currently sitting in the wood shop mezzanine, as once they are built they can be sold for a decent profit, to this end a budget of $260 for 4x 18mm plywood sheets is sought initially so we can construct a set of speakers to display for speaker construction classes; 0 opposed, 0 abstained, ****motion passed****.
- Ladders ($700) - we are looking for various ladders, in particular for use in the wood shop but can be used for other works in and around the Space; 0 opposed, 0 abstained, ****motion passed****.
- Bandsaw (approx. $3000) - we are seeking a larger bandsaw for the woodshop, and are currently in discussions with the manufacturer regarding other tooling that we can obtain for a 10% discount; this can be used for other works, and would assist with attraction of new members; 4 opposed, 6 abstained, ****motion passed****.
- Key Trackers ($200) - we have had issues where site keys have disappeared in cars, so we are looking to purchase key trackers so we can determine where the site keys are located; these can be tracked via Bluetooth; 0 opposed, 0 abstained, ****motion passed****.
