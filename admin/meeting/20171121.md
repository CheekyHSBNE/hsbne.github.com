## Agenda
- 3D Scanning Rig
- Folding Trolleys
- HSBNE T-Shirts
- Storage Policy Discussion
- Supanova review
- Real Estate News

## Meeting Notes
- Storage Policy discussion - The executive are discussing the arrangement with Wonky and Modifyre directly; there is a plan being implemented to rearrange the hard stand area, with the boneyard being moved to the two far containers and the region between them; there is also a "doom region" being assigned for both the woodshop and metal shop; 0 opposed, 1 abstained, ****motion passed****.
- Supanova review - This year's show was very successful in both drawing new interest in the Space and also financially, as the 3D Scan and Print was a major draw card. We will be looking at holding a booth at the Brisbane show in 2018.
- Real Estate News - The final version of the lease for the site has been signed, giving us November 30th 2018 as our final date for tenancy. As our future at this site is uncertain in the wake of the State Election, we will be sourcing potential sites for our new location; any suggestions are welcome in this matter.

## Treasury Report
- $2500 for causes to spend, not including Supanova revenue

## Votes
- 3D Scanning Rig - As this was a very successful component of the booth at Supanova, we are looking to complement or revise the method of scanning people for printing; a Structure scanner comes with the appropriate software licence for Skanect and is well priced for the purpose; we will be complementing this with one of the donated laptops for scan optimisation and finalisation; 0 opposed, 0 abstained, ****motion passed****.
- Folding Trolleys - These are required for transport of equipment to and from events, and will be clearly identifiable as being owned by HSBNE, these are the type that are able to be stored flat, but can move a large amount of items; 0 opposed, 1 abstained, ****motion passed****.
- HSBNE T-Shirts - we will be purchasing a number of t-shirts for members to wear at events, our current quote per shirt is $30.64 but we are looking for a better quote as 2XL and higher costs extra; 0 opposed, 1 abstained, ****motion passed****.
