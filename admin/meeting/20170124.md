## Meeting Notes
 - Please keep the outer benched clean.
 - Volunteers needed for WSF. Application for bluecards are required. 
 - Meeting in the classroom for supanova GC. Group accomidation is being looked into. 
 - Old ethernet switch donated by friend of mike's died and has been monkeypatched. This is needed to communicate with cameras and 
 - Sublimation printer, inks and papers so we can make mugs, plates, t-shirts etc- with your own full graphic images on them. We have plans to make products we can sell at events, and HSBNE branded items. Craft Punk will be using our own funds for some of the purchase, but we simply can't cover it all, and seeing as it will be a tool that is useful and profitable for the whole space, we'd like help from the general members to purchase this setup. As some of you might know, we were donated the heaters for applying the sublimation prints to mugs, plates and T-shirts/flat things. These alone would have cost a couple of thousand dollars, so it would be great to make use of them.
 - Blacksmithing and casting meeting held after GM.
 - Hulk update - Working but very difficult to operate. Around $2000 is needed to tool it up for production operation.
 -  craft punk gained ~4 new members and was successful.
