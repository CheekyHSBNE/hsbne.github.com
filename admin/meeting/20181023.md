## Agenda
- Special General Meeting to elect new Treasurer
- Quick-change Tool Post and Drum Sander (up to $2500 for both items)

## Meeting Notes
- There will be a meeting held soon to discuss what the causes are and how they can be improved upon
- There will be a Supanova meeting held on the 30th of October to discuss the layout and final organisation of the booth; if you have indicated that you wish to volunteer you must either attend or let Doc know beforehand.
- If the doors aren't opening, please let us know so we can determine the problem.
- We are examining options to implement Stripe payments for membership, this will be implemented for new memberships; this item is subject to further discussion.
- If you have not already signed up to the new portal system please do so as your site access is dependant on this.
- We have new tools in CraftPunk, as well as a new 3d scanner for small items in DigiFab.

## Treasury Report
- No treasury report given

## Votes
- New Treasurer - Due to the departure of our previous treasurer, we need to elect a new one; Jaimyn Mayer elected unopposed.
- Quick-change Tool Post for lathe and Drum Sander (up to $2500) - The drum sander is the last piece of equipment we need for the wood shop to be fully operational, and the quick-change tool post of the lathe will allow us to use more types of tooling as well as allowing for more adjustment and faster works; 8 opposed, 6 abstentions, ****motion passed for Drum Sander****; 7 opposed, 4 abstentions, ****motion passed for Tool Post****.
- SpaceBucks RFID Donation Terminal kit (up to $350) - These will allow people to use their SpaceBucks for more than just the drinks machines, for instance donating extra funds directly to causes; 0 opposed, 0 abstentions, ****motion passed****.
