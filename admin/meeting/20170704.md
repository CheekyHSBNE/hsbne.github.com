## Treasury Report

## Votes
	- Horizontal Bandsaw - a hydraulic unit that is an upgrade to the one we already have, Hare and Forbes can give us a discount due to our non-profit status, required in a hurry so we can't use grant money to pay for this; 1 opposed, 2 abstained, motion passed.
    - Radiation Sensor - HSBNE is listed on SpaceDirectory, a site that lists various recordable items about the area surrounding various hackerspaces, this item will be mounted in a specific position and will record background radiation to post to SpaceDirectory; 0 opposed, 1 abstained, motion passed.
    - Chromecast Ultra - we are having issues with Youtube on the Green Room television, znd as such we are looking to upgrade the Chromecast that is attached to one that can be plugged directly into the network, the old unit will be transferred to the classroom for the projector; 0 opposed, 0 abstained, motion passed.
    - Interlock v.2 Budget - the new protoype should be more narrow than the current unit that is on the tablesaw, the cost should be less than $100 for the current transformer and other parts to make the prototype, once this is successful there will be a construction day scheduled for mass-production of the new interlocks; 0 opposed, 0 abstained, motion passed.
