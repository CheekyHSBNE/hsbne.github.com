## Agenda
- Drinks Account ($500/month)
- Purchase of Ollie's Lathe ($2000)

## Meeting Notes
- A meeting between HSBNE, Wendy (our landlord) and Daniel (from Colliers) took place; our lease has been extended to the end of November 2018, but we are unsure if we are able to take the remaining options for lease extension due to EDQ; our access to the front carpark has been confirmed
- A new 3D printer has been donated by one of our former members; the Up Mini will be integrated with the current 'Space systems and will be ready for use within two weeks

## Treasury Report
- $4500 for causes to spend

## Votes
- Ollie's Lathe - this lathe was lent to us based on the understanding that it may need to be purchased at a later date; it is a very well maintained lathe that is being slowly converted to CNC usage (this task can be completed with parts that have been provided); 0 opposed, 4 abstained, ****motion passed****.
- Drinks Budget - the initial budget was voted upon approximately 4 years ago, and has up until recently been maintained wholly and solely by drinks purchases; a $500 per month rolling budget was proposed; 0 opposed, 0 abstained, ****motion passed****.

## Thanks
- Nog and Buzz for cleaning the Quad before the landlord meeting
- All attending CNC Nights
- All assisting with site tours
