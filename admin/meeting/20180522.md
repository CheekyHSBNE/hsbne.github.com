## Votes
- ShopVacs - Three units are required to replace our failing vacuum cleaners in the metal shop, the wood shop and CraftPunk, with a view to purchasing additional units in the future; 0 opposed, 0 abstained, ****motion passed****.
- Cameras with IR - We are replacing the non-functional cameras with units that have IR capability, this will improve video coverage to almost the whole of the site (gate, hallway, hardstand, quad, metal shop, wood shop, green room); 0 opposed, 1 abstained, ****motion passed****.
- Network Switch - Further from the previous point, a new network switch is required for the combined Metal/Wood shop area to support the installation of the new cameras; 0 opposed, 1 abstained, ****motion passed****.
- WiFi equipment - Our current WiFi infrastructure is lacking in both range and effective speed. With the majority of members and guests utilising the WiFi to access the Internet, the old access points need to be replaced with modern equivalents to potentially future-proof our site, including long-range units to connect the external buildings; 0 opposed, 1 abstained, ****motion passed****.
- Maglocks - To alleviate security concerns with regards to the toilet door and Members' Storage, paired with a door closer for Members' Storage; 0 opposed, 0 abstained, ****motion passed****.
