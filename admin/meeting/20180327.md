## Agenda
    - $2500 budget for new camera setup.

## Meeting Notes
	- Meeting with Wendy went decently well. Consultation by the government has indicated that spending on Innovation precincts is favourable and so we may end up with a new lease but there's no solid commitment yet.
  - AGM on 24th April, reminder that all positions are available for nomination and that members should speak with current executive if they are interested for more details.
## Treasury Report
 	- Approx $4600 to spend.

## Votes
	- $2500 budget for new camera setup - 0 against, 0 abstaining. Motion passes.

## Thanks
