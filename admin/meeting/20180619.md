## Agenda
- Wall-mount Server Rack ($260)

## Meeting Notes
- Please scramble the lock-box code, as this is part of our requirements for site security
- There is a proposal to create an automotive cause, where members are able to work on their vehicles and are able to seek funds for tooling and consumables
- The WiFi and camera infrastructure has been upgraded
- The tooling interlock code has been updated - please swipe on and swipe off when using the larger tools 

## Treasury Report
- No treasury report given

## Votes
- Wall-mount Server Rack ($260) - this is integral to recovering space within the server room, as the current rack is under-utilised to the point of being a waste of space in itself; with a smaller unit we are able to make space underneath for a shelving unit; 0 opposed, 0 abstained, ****motion passed****.

## Thanks
- Thanks to Brendan for sourcing and installing the networking equipment
- Thanks to Beau for installing the new network rack in the secondary building
- Thanks to Josh for fixing the coffee machine and installing a chicken soup dispenser
